# config-nvim

My personal neovim config. Written in lua, no longer so minimal in terms of packages.
Uses Space keys for window/tab switching and telescope functions.

## packages

- goyo
- emmet (For html expansion)
- telescope (assorted functions)
- gruvbox (colorscheme)
- rose-pine (colorscheme)
- nvim-cmp (For autocompletiono)
- Other packages to make autocompletion work
- LSP support with lsp-zero

These are tiny QOL packages 
- jiangmiao/auto-pairs
- tpope/vim-commentary

As well as language packages for:
- nim
- javascript
